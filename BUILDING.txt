Apache Commons JEXL uses Maven 3 as the build tool, and requires Java 8 (or above).

The following Maven goals are useful:

* mvn - Runs all checks.
* mvn clean - Deletes all files from the target folder.
* mvn test - Compiles and run the unit tests.
* mvn site - Creates the web site and documentation.
* mvn package - Builds the jar.
* mvn install - Builds the jar and installs it in the local Maven repository.

Note that the Maven build process uses JavaCC to generate some sources.
These are created under target/generated sources and automatically compiled.
The generated class files are needed to compile some of the ordinary Java source files.
This can cause problems for some IDEs, which will need to be configured accordingly.
