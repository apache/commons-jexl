                            Commons JEXL Package
                                Version 2.0
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:
=============

JEXL is an Expression Language supporting most of the constructs in the
JSTL Expression Language, along with some additional extensions.

  http://commons.apache.org/jexl/

Changes in this version include:

Incompatible Changes
====================

Now requires Java 1.5 or later.

Version 2.0 resides in the org.apache.commons.jexl2 package; part of the version 1.x API is reimplemented as an
add-on source library in the jexl-compat directory; since it can not fully reimplement the original public 1.x, it may
only be used to ease transition in strictly controlled deployments.

The following classes are implemented through the jexl-compat source library:
  * ExpressionFactory
  * ScriptFactory
  * Expression
  * Script
  * JexlContext
  * JexlHelper

Migration notes
===============

When migrating from jexl 1.x to jexl 2.0, the following hints may be helpfull.

The following classes no longer exist:
  * ExpressionFactory, ScriptFactory: create a JexlEngine and use createExpression() or createScript()
  instead.

The following classes have been renamed and replaced:

  * VelMethod <=> JexlMethod
  * VelPropertyGet <=> JexlPropertyGet
  * VelPropertySet <=> JexlPropertySet

The following methods have been removed:

  * Info.getTemplateName() - use Info.getName() instead
  * Expression.addPostResolver() / Expression.addPreResolver() - set ant-like variables in JexlContext, implement
    a specific JexlContext or derive JexlcontextInterpreter/JexlEngine instead

Behavior changes
================

* Public fields are considered when using JexlPropertyGet / JexlPropertySet: Jexl 1.x behavior can be reimplemented
by subclassing UberspectImpl.

*Division (/ operator) behavior change: division between integers no longer casts its operands to double; integer division
    allways results in a integer. The 1.x behavior can be reimplemented by subclassing JexlArithmetic.

New Features:
=============

Assignment expression: a = b (and a.b.c = d)
   * Assigns a variable (ant-like variable or bean-property)

Ternary operator expression: a ? b : c  (and a ?: c)
   * The usual inline conditional shortcut and its 'Elvis' form (a ?: b evaluates as a ? a : b)

Constructor call expression: new('my.class.name', arguments...)
   * Creates a new instance of a class using the most appropriate constructor according
     to the actual arguments

Function namespace: ns:func(arguments...)
   * A function namespace allows the use of class or instance methods in function calls

UnifiedJEXL
   * Adds ${...} and #{...} JSP/EL syntax support on top of the JexlEngine

JSR-223 support
   * Implement JSR-223 Scripting Engine for JEXL script (need BSF-3.0 on Java < 6)

Error and exception handling
   * Configuring the leniency and verbosity of the Jexl engine allows user control over the
     error handling policy

Bugs fixed in 2.0.1:
====================

* JEXL-100:     Array access expressions fail when evaluated twice and cache is enabled
* JEXL-99:      Documentation of Thread Safety / Invalid code examples on homepage
* JEXL-98:      Quote escaping cannot be escaped

* JEXL-27:	Cannot assign a value to the property of an object, such as object.prop = value.
* JEXL-26:	ASTArrayAccess messes up on fallback to JexlContext
