                                Version 1.1
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:
=============

Jexl is an Expression Language supporting most of the constructs in the
JSTL Expression Language, along with some additional extensions.

http://commons.apache.org/jexl/

Changes in this version include:

Incompatible Changes
====================

Now requires Java 1.5 or later

The following classes and methods have been removed:

* ExpressionFactory
* ScriptFactory

Please create a JexlEngine() and us createExpression() or createScript() instead.

* JexlEngine.getDefault() was used by the above. Use "new JexlEngine()" instead

* Info.getTemplateName() - use Info.getName() instead
New Features:
=============

o Added Script and ScriptFactory to allow scripts to be executed from text,
  files or a URL.
o Added implementation for bitwise operators: and, complement, or, xor.
o Added implementation for the foreach statement.
o Added implementation for the while statement.
o Added implementation for block statements, e.g. curly braces containing
  multiple statements.
o Added implementation for the if statement.
o [JEXL-4] Support assignment to variables. Thanks to Barry Lagerweij.

Bugs fixed:
===========

o [JEXL-17] Consistently throw ParseException in case of a parsing failure,
  not an Error. Thanks to Kohsuke Kawaguchi.
o [JEXL-3] Allow for static methods to be called on classes and not just objects.
  Thanks to Guido Anzuoni.
o [JEXL-6] Unary minus was only working for integer values.
o [JEXL-5] 'abc'.substring(0,1+1) is empty (method matching problem).

Other Changes:
==============

o Add @since tags to code so we can track API additions via javadoc
