    <title>Apache Commons JEXL JSR-223 (scripting) Reference</title>
  </properties>

  <body>
    <section name="Overview">
      <p>
      Apache Commons JEXL includes JSR-223 (javax.script) support.
      The binary jar includes the scripting factory
      and the services definition javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory,
      so no special configuration is needed.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Script engine support">
      <p>
      The provided script engine implements the following (engineVersion="1.0"):
      <ul>
      <li>Language names: "JEXL", "Jexl", "jexl"</li>
      <li>Extensions: ".jexl"</li>
      <li>Mime-types: "application/x-jexl"</li>
      </ul>
      Script Engine versions from "3.0" also implement the following:
      <ul>
      <li>Language names:  "JEXL2", "Jexl2", "jexl2", "JEXL3", "Jexl3", "jexl3"</li>
      <li>Extensions: ".jexl2", ".jexl3"</li>
      <li>Mime-types: "application/x-jexl2", "application/x-jexl3"</li>
      </ul>
      The implementation adds an instance of
      <a href="https://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl/scripting/JexlScriptObject.html">JexlScriptObject</a>
      to the engine context as the variable "JEXL".
      This gives scripts easier access to various items such as System.out and a logger.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Using the JSR-223 JEXL test application">
        <p>
        The binary release includes a command-line application which can be used to exercise the JSR-223 script engine.
        For example:
        <source>java -cp commons-jexl-3.1.jar;commons-logging-1.2.jar
            org.apache.commons.jexl3.scripting.Main script.jexl</source>
        If a single argument is provided, then that is assumed to be the name of a script file;
        otherwise, the application prompts for script input to be evaluated.
        In both cases, the variable "args" contains the command-line arguments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section name="JSR-223 support classes">
      <p>
        The classes used to support JSR-223 scripting access are:
        <ul>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl3.scripting.JexlScriptEngineFactory - the factory</li>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl3.scripting.JexlScriptEngine - the engine</li>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl2.scripting.JexlScriptObject - class used to give scripts access to JEXL objects</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
