    <title>Commons JEXL JSR-223 (scripting) Reference</title>
  </properties>

  <body>
    <section name="Overview">
      <p>
      Commons JEXL includes JSR-223 (javax.script) support.
      The binary jar includes the scripting factory
      and the services definition javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory, 
      so no special configuration is needed.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Script engine support">
      <p>
      The provided script engine implements the following:
      <ul>
      <li>Language names: "JEXL", "Jexl", "jexl"</li>
      <li>Extensions: ".jexl"</li>
      <li>Mime-types: "application/x-jexl"</li>
      </ul>
      The implementation adds an instance of 
      <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl/scripting/JexlScriptObject.html">JexlScriptObject</a>
      to the engine context as the variable "JEXL". 
      This gives scripts easier access to various items such as System.out and a logger.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Using the JSR-223 JEXL test application">
        <p>
        The binary release includes a command-line application which can be used to exercise the JSR-223 script engine.
        For example:
        <source>java -cp commons-jexl-2.0.1.jar;commons-logging-1.1.1.jar[;bsf-api-3.0.jar] org.apache.commons.jexl2.scripting.Main script.jexl</source>
        If a single argument is provided, then that is assumed to be the name of a script file;
        otherwise, the application prompts for script input to be evaluated.
        In both cases, the variable "args" contains the command-line arguments.
        [Note that Java 1.5 does not include javax.script support; you will need to use the Apache BSF API jar as indicated.]
        </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Using JEXL with JSR-223 on Java 1.5">
      <p>
      In order to use JEXL via JSR-223 on Java 1.5, you need to add Apache BSF-API 3.0 jar to the classpath.
      JEXL also requires Commons Logging on the classpath.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Using JEXL with JSR-223 on Java 1.6+">
      <p>
      JSR-223 support is included with Java 1.6+. 
      JEXL requires Commons Logging, which needs to be included in the path.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="JSR-223 support classes">
      <p>
        The classes used to support JSR-223 scripting access are:
        <ul>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl2.scripting.JexlScriptEngineFactory - the factory</li>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl2.scripting.JexlScriptEngine - the engine</li>
        <li>org.apache.commons.jexl2.scripting.JexlScriptObject - class used to give scripts access to JEXL objects</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
