/**
 * This interface describes permissions used by JEXL introspection that constrain which
 * packages/classes/constructors/fields/methods are made visible to JEXL scripts.
 * <p>By specifying or implementing permissions, it is possible to constrain precisely which objects can be manipulated
 * by JEXL, allowing users to enter their own expressions or scripts whilst maintaining tight control
 * over what can be executed. JEXL introspection mechanism will check whether it is permitted to
 * access a constructor, method or field before exposition to the {@link JexlUberspect}. The restrictions
 * are applied in all cases, for any {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.introspection.JexlUberspect.ResolverStrategy}.
 * </p>
 * <p>This complements using a dedicated {@link ClassLoader} and/or {@link SecurityManager} - being deprecated -
 * and possibly {@link JexlSandbox} with a simpler mechanism. The {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.annotations.NoJexl}
 * annotation processing is actually performed using the result of calling {@link #parse(String...)} with no arguments;
 * implementations shall delegate calls to its methods for {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.annotations.NoJexl} to be
 * processed.</p>
 * <p>A simple textual configuration can be used to create user defined permissions using
 * {@link JexlPermissions#parse(String...)}.</p>
 *<p>To instantiate a JEXL engine using permissions, one should use a {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.JexlBuilder}
 * and call {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.JexlBuilder#permissions(JexlPermissions)}. Another approach would
 * be to instantiate a {@link JexlUberspect} with those permissions and call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.JexlBuilder#uberspect(JexlUberspect)}.</p>

     * Parses a set of permissions.
     * <p>
     * In JEXL 3.3, the syntax recognizes 2 types of permissions:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Allowing access to a wildcard restricted set of packages. </li>
     * <li>Denying access to packages, classes (and inner classes), methods and fields</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>Wildcards specifications determine the set of allowed packages. When empty, all packages can be
     * used. When using JEXL to expose functional elements, their packages should be exposed through wildcards.
     * These allow composing the volume of what is allowed by addition.</p>
     * <p>Restrictions behave exactly like the {@link org.apache.commons.jexl3.annotations.NoJexl} annotation;
     * they can restrict access to package, class, inner-class, methods and fields.
     *  These allow refining the volume of what is allowed by extrusion.</p>
     *  An example of a tight environment that would not allow scripts to wander could be:
     *  <pre>
     *  # allow a very restricted set of base classes
     *  java.math.*
     *  java.text.*
     *  java.util.*
     *  # deny classes that could pose a security risk
     *  java.lang { Runtime {} System {} ProcessBuilder {} Class {} }
     *  org.apache.commons.jexl3 { JexlBuilder {} }
     *  </pre>
     *  <p>
     *  Syntax for wildcards is the name of the package suffixed by <code>.*</code>. Syntax for restrictions is
     *  a list of package restrictions. A package restriction is a package name followed by a block
     *  (as in curly-bracket block {}) that contains a list of class restrictions. A class restriction is a class name
     *  followed by a block of member restrictions. A member restriction can be a class restriction - to restrict
     *  nested classes -, a field which is the Java field name suffixed with <code>;</code>, a method composed of
     *  its Java name suffixed with <code>();</code>. Constructor restrictions are specified like methods using the
     *  class name as method name.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  All overrides and overloads of a constructors or method are allowed or restricted at the same time,
     *  the restriction being based on their names, not their whole signature. This differs from the @NoJexl annotation.
     *  </p>
     *  <pre>
     *  # some wildcards
     *  java.lang.*; # java.lang is pretty much a must have
     *  my.allowed.package0.*
     *  another.allowed.package1.*
     *  # nojexl like restrictions
     *  my.package.internal {} # the whole package is hidden

     *     class2 {
